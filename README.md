# HFacts 

For this project, I incorporated Android concepts into a mobile design for use by the general public, family, colleagues, friends, or other volunteers with the Annual Heart Walk.  The topics, content and themes relate to previous projects I designed and developed (websites and databases featuring HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP).

As I learn more about mobile design and Java programming, future application enhancements for this Android installment include more user-interactivity, beginning with a call to other, larger APIs.
